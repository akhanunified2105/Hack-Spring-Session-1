make a new project
show file directory
go to AppDelegate
	show `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`
	explain this is where the app detects when the app is opened or closed
go to ViewController
	this is the VC in MVC
	show viewDidLoad and say its a built in function like the others (viewDidAppear)
go to storyboard
	explain the view that current shows is the View in MVC and is linked to the class ViewController.swift
	explain various sidebars and show the storyboard-code side by side
	explain what we're trying to make (minimal user profile: 3 labels (name, age, points) 2 button where some labels text are set in storyboard, some are programmatically set)
	drag 3 labels into view
	drag 2 button into view
	rename them all
	RUN IT! (make sure to resize the emulator screen scale)
		Note: running emulator for the first time may cause it to take some time to "reload" the phone and run
		- the buttons dont do anything now because we havent connected them with any code yet! this connection between the code and our view is called an IBOutlet
	make IBOutlets 
		hover over the outlet circles to show the corresponding label hilighted in the view
		explain the IBOutlet variable declaration
	make User class w/ name, age, points to be Model in MVC
	set values of labels programmatically in viewDidLoad from User object
	RUN IT
	the initial value of labels can be set in Storyboard but assuming you want some dynamic content to show on first load, then setting values in viewDidLoad is how you do it
	change the setting of pointsLabel to the value of self.points
		self.pointsLabel.text = "\(self.user.points)"
	make button IBActions
		hover over IBAction circles
		explain IBAction function signature
	implement actions
	RUN IT

	DONE
